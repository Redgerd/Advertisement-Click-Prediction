# **Advertisement Click Prediction**

In this notebook we will look at the theory behind Logistic Regression and use it to indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicks on an Advertisement based off the features of that user.

This dataset contains information related to consumer behavior and advertisement engagement. Here are the features included:

- `Daily Time Spent on Site`: Duration of consumer's visit to the website in minutes.
- `Age`: Age of the consumer in years.
- `Area Income`: Average income of the geographical area where the consumer resides.
- `Daily Internet Usage`: Average minutes per day spent by the consumer on the internet.
- `Ad Topic Line`: Headline of the advertisement.
- `City`: City of the consumer.
- `Male`: Binary variable indicating whether the consumer is male (1) or not (0).
- `Country`: Country of the consumer.
- `Timestamp`: Time at which the consumer clicked on the ad or closed the window.
- `Clicked on Ad`: Binary variable indicating whether the consumer clicked on the ad (1) or not (0).
